            <h2><span class="material-symbols-outlined md-dark">comment_bank</span>What is Universal Design ?</h2>

            <p>
                Universal Design is the design and composition of an environment so that it can be accessed, understood
                and used to the greatest extent possible by all people regardless of their age, size, ability or
                disability. An environment (or any building, product, or service in that environment) should be designed
                to meet the needs of all people who wish to use it. This is not a special requirement, for the benefit
                of only a minority of the population. It is a fundamental condition of good design. If an environment is
                accessible, usable, convenient and a pleasure to use, everyone benefits. By considering the diverse
                needs and abilities of all throughout the design process, universal design creates products, services
                and environments that meet peoples' needs. Simply put, universal design is good design.
            </p>

            <a id="Topic2">
                <h3>Universal Design should incorporate a <strong>two level</strong> approach:</h3>
                <p>

                    <br>1. User-Aware Design: pushing the boundaries of 'mainstream' products, services and environments
                    to include
                    as many people as possible.
                    <br>2. Customisable Design: design to minimise the difficulties of adaptation to particular users.


                    With both levels in mind, it can also be helpful to view universal design at a micro and macro
                    level.

            <a id="Topic3">
                <h3>Viewing Universal Design at the Micro level</h3>
                <p>A single design feature or a simple product, designed so that it can be used by as many people as
                    possible.</p>
                <p>At this level, the designer is not expected to find one design solution that accommodates the needs
                    of 100% of the population, as Universal Design is not one size fits all. Rather, designers are urged
                    to explore design solutions that are more inclusive; those designs that push the boundaries as far
                    out as possible without compromising the integrity or quality of the product.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If more than one option is available for a design feature, choose the more inclusive feature. For
                    example, when installing a handle on a door, it is always better to opt for a lever handle, rather
                    than a door knob, as the lever handle can be opened using the elbow or a closed fist, benefiting
                    people carrying shopping bags as well as people with limited strength in their hands.</p>

            </a>

            <a id="Topic4">
                <h3> Viewing Universal Design at the Macro Level </h3>
                <p>At this level the designer has the opportunity to combine accessible and usable design features, with
                    customisable or adaptable features, alongside more specialised design solutions that deal with the
                    most extreme usability issues </p>
                <p>By stepping back from the individual features and looking at the product, service or environment as a
                    whole, designers are in a position to investigate alternatives providing equivalent experiences to
                    users.
                </p>
                <p>From micro to macro, Universal Design has implications for the design of any single feature of a
                    product, service or environment, as well as the design of that product, service or environment as a
                    whole.</p>

            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Principle 1: Equitable Use
                    <p>The design is useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Principle 2: Flexibility in Use<p>The design accommodates a wide range of individual preferences and
                        abilities.

                    </p>
                </li>
                <li> Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use<p>Use of the design is easy to understand, regardless of the
                        user's experience, knowledge, language skills, or current concentration level. </p>
                </li>
                <li>Principle 4: Perceptible Information <p>The design communicates necessary information effectively to
                        the user, regardless of ambient conditions or the user's sensory abilities. </p>
                </li>
                <li>Principle 5: Tolerance for Error <p>The design minimizes hazards and the adverse consequences of
                        accidental or unintended actions. </p>
                </li>
                <li>Principle 6: Low Physical Effort
                    <p>The design can be used efficiently and comfortably and with a minimum of fatigue.

                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use
                    <p>Appropriate size and space is provided for approach, reach, manipulation, and use regardless of
                        user's body size, posture, or mobility.

                    </p>
