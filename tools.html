                <h2>What evaluation tools can do and can not do </h2>
                <p>Web accessibility evaluation tools can help you quickly identify potential accessibility issues. You
                    can
                    use them through all phases of the web design and development process. Tools can provide
                    fully-automated
                    checks, and help you with manual review.</p>
                <p>We cannot check all accessibility aspects automatically. Human judgement is required. Sometimes
                    evaluation tools can produce false or misleading results. Web accessibility evaluation tools can not
                    determine accessibility, they can only assist in doing so.</p>

                    <li> Guidelines
                        <p>Different organizations and governments may require conformance with different accessibility
                            standards, thus different tools support these standards. The W3C Web Content Accessibility
                            Guidelines (WCAG) is internationally recognized as the standard for web accessibility, and
                            supported
                            by most tools.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Language
                        <p>Evaluation tools support different languages. This includes the user interface of the tools,
                            as
                            well
                            as the language of the content they support (for example, for detecting language-related
                            barriers).

                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Type of Tool
                        <p>Evaluation tools can be plugins (extensions) for authoring tools and web browsers, command
                            line
                            tools, desktop or mobile applications, and online services. Different tools may be combined,
                            depending on your design and development process.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Supported Formats
                        <p>Most evaluation tools check the accessibility of HTML content. Some check other web
                            technologies,
                            such as WAI-ARIA, CSS, SVG, and PDF.</p>

                    <li>Assists by
                        <p>Some web accessibility evaluation tools can be used in more than one way. The following are
                            some common characteristics used to support the evaluation process:
                        <dl>
                            <dt><br> Reports are useful to determine the conformance of the checkpoints that can be
                                automatically checked.
                            </dt>
                            <dt> <br>Step-by-step evaluations: Wizard-based evaluation tools guide users through
                                sequences
                                of
                                checks.
                                They
                                conduct automated checks and prompt the user to manually assess the rest. For example, a
                                wizard-based
                                tool may check images for alternate text. The user then evaluates how appropriate the
                                alternate
                                text is.
                            </dt>

                            <dt><br> In-page feedback: This feature inserts temporary icons and markup to display
                                results
                                of
                                accessibility
                                checks. They are useful to view issues in context. They are also useful to understand
                                the
                                relative
                                importance of each issue.
                            </dt>

                            <dt><br> Page transformation: Transformation tools change the appearance of a site to help
                                identify
                                design
                                issues. For example, the tool may show the site in text only or without color. These
                                tools
                                are
                                useful to
                                compensate for the limitations of automated testing.

                    <li>Automatically Checks
                        <p>The scope of what the evaluation tool can automatically test varies depending on the tool.
                            Some
                            tools
                            check a single page, while others check entire groups of related pages. Some can also access
                            password-restricted content.</p>

                    <li>License
                        <p>Evaluation tools are available under a variety of license types, such as Open Source,
                            Commercial,
                            Enterprise, etc.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Accessibility Information
                        <p>It is important that evaluation tools are accessible so that people with disabilities can use
                            them.
                            Some tools provide information on how well they support accessibility.
